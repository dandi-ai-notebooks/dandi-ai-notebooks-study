# Review Session Instructions

Thank you so much for helping with the DANDI AI Notebook project. In this project, we are using LLM tools to generate introductory notebooks for public DANDI datasets, with the goal of making data reuse easier.

The review session will focus on 12 AI-generated notebooks. We have allocated an hour for reviewing notebooks individually while on the call, so plan for about **5 minutes per notebook**. Please do your best to evaluate the notebook as a whole. You may not have time to read every word. After we are all done, we will discuss the results together. Your objective feedback will help us evaluate the system and guide improvements. You may ask clarifying questions about the process, but please avoid discussing the notebooks themselves until all reviews are complete.

Some of the questions ask you to open Neurosift links to NWB files in order to inspect what data are available. You can find those links at the bottom of the [review table page](https://github.com/dandi-ai-notebooks/dandi-ai-notebooks-6/blob/main/to_review.md). Not all objects will render in Neurosift, but remember that you are reviewing the notebook, not Neurosift.

How to Review:

Important: Use Chrome, Brave, or Safari. Firefox may not render notebooks correctly.

1. Open the [review table](https://github.com/dandi-ai-notebooks/dandi-ai-notebooks-6/blob/main/to_review.md).
2. Click a "notebook review" link.
3. Log in using your API token (contact an admin if needed).
4. Read the notebook and complete the review form on the left.
5. Click "Finalize Review" when done.

Repeat for the remaining notebooks.

Thanks again for your time and input. It is critical to the success of this project.
